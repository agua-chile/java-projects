## Getting Started

Welcome to my Java projects. I took all of my classwork
in Java and put them together in this repository in a 
way that they can all be accesses through the same Java
project. Running the code provides a menu that allows
you to select which project you would like to run.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have Java installed on your computer to
run this project. You can download it from the Oracle
website [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

### Installing

To install this project, you will need to clone the repository
to your computer. You can do this by running the following
command in your terminal:

```git clone```
